# Number Recognition with Keras.Sequential on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of number recognition using the popular MNIST dataset. The model is built using Keras.Sequential, utilizing layers for neural network architecture and the Adam optimizer for efficient training.

## Highlights:

- **Model:** Keras.Sequential with layers
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Dataset:** MNIST (handwritten digits)
- **Objective:** Achieving high accuracy in number recognition

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Riddhigupta3011/Deep_learning_models/Number-Recognition-MNIST.git
    cd Number-Recognition-MNIST
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python script for the model implementation.
