# Number Recognition on MNIST Dataset

Welcome to the "Number Recognition on MNIST" deep learning project! This project focuses on building a number recognition model using the Keras.Sequential model, layers, and the Adam optimizer, achieving high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

## Highlights:

- **Model:** Keras.Sequential with layers
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Dataset:** MNIST (handwritten digits)
- **Objective:** Achieving high accuracy in number recognition

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the entire "Deep learning models" repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Riddhigupta3011/Deep_learning_models.git
    cd Deep_learning_models
    ```

2. Navigate to the "Number-Recognition-MNIST" folder:

    ```bash
    cd Number-Recognition-MNIST
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Explore the project files and directories.
